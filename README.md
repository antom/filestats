# filestats.c

This is a piece of coursework I completed whilst studying for a BSc in Web & Multimedia at the [University of Central Lancashire](http://www.uclan.ac.uk) - specifically assignment 2 of the [Program Design & Implementation module (EL1113) in 2002/3](http://www.spplatt.co.uk/papers/programming/pdic99.pdf). Programmed in ANSI C & originally compiled with Borland C++ Compiler v5.5 (bcc32).

The assignment was, from memory, to program a text file analysis program.

The source code was last edited on the 3rd April 2003.

Whilst the source code is unedited, the original DOS executable submitted was corrupt, so a newly compiled executable for OSX is included in this repository.

To compile:

*GCC*
```
gcc -o filestats filestats.c
```

*bcc32*
```
bcc32 filestats.c
```
